# coin-detection-coiny-model1
This is the first step of the coin detection model we are building. Here, we are implementing HoughCircles from the open cv library and detecting the coins from the image, giving us a good idea of the implemention of the algorithm. We'll be updating our work from here on. Our future focus will be giving the denominations of the coins as well to give us an algorithm for daily use. 

## Libraries
